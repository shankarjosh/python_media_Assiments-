    "Syntax:                In Python, indentation is not just a convention; it's a part of the language syntax. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors, causing the code to fail during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic and Flow Control: Indentation helps to define the logical flow of the program. It clarifies which statements are part of a loop, conditional, or function. Incorrect indentation can alter the logic of the code, leading to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging:             Properly indented code is easier to debug. When encountering an error, developers can quickly identify which block of code is causing the problem and trace the issue more efficiently.\n",

    "Maintainability:      Well-indented code is easier to maintain and modify. When adding new features or making changes to existing code, developers can quickly understand how different parts of the code are organized and interconnected.\n",
